# WEBSITE_UPDATE.md â€” Add Project to Portfolio

1) Open your portfolio site's project section for editing.
2) Paste the Monitoring Stack snippet (from docs/PROJECT_SNIPPETS.md).
3) Link to your GitHub repo once it's pushed.
4) Add one screenshot (Grafana dashboard) to make the section visually strong.
5) Repeat for the other planned projects (mark as In Progress or Planned).

If your portfolio is built from a GitHub repo, commit the content update and push.
If you're using a site builder, paste the text via its editor and save/publish.
